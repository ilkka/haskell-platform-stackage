Haskell Platform Stackage Docker image
======================================

This Dockerfile builds a Docker image that has a working, modern Haskell
platform installation with Cabal configured to use a Stackage exclusive
snapshot.


Usage
-----

This image can just be run and it'll spawn a shell. You probably want to use it
as a basis for some more specific dev env and preinstall some packages.
